# ðŸ“¸ Logo Instructions

You need to add these company logos to `public/images/`:

## Required Logos:

1. **lennar-logo.png** - Download Lennar logo and save as this filename

   - https://www.lennar.com (grab their logo)
   - Or search "Lennar logo png" and download

2. **home-depot-logo.png** - You may already have Home Depot logo
   - Check if you have it, if not download from their site

## Quick Fix:

Until you add the logos, you can:

1. Remove the logo images temporarily
2. Or the site will show a broken image icon (still works fine)

The site will work perfectly without these, they're just nice-to-have visuals!
