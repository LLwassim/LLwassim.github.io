# Featured Work Carousel - Implementation Summary

## 🎬 Overview

Transformed the static "Featured Work" grid into a **living, breathing infinite carousel** with an ethereal ambient background. This creates a premium, engaging experience that showcases projects continuously.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Infinite Looping Carousel**

- **GSAP-powered smooth animation**: Continuous horizontal scrolling that never stops
- **Seamless loop**: Items are duplicated 3x to create an endless effect with no visible reset
- **Interactive pause**: Hover over the carousel to pause and examine details
- **Speed**: ~8 seconds per item for a relaxed, luxurious pace
- **Performance**: Uses GPU-accelerated transforms only (`translateX`)

### 2. **Ethereal Ambient Background**

Distinct from the hero section, featuring:

- **Animated gradient orbs**: 3 large spheres that float and morph slowly
  - Blue-purple orb (top-left): 25s cycle
  - Purple-pink orb (right): 30s cycle
  - Cyan-blue orb (bottom): 28s cycle
- **Floating particles**: 30 micro-particles with independent float animations
- **Ambient light rays**: Radial gradient overlay for depth
- **Color palette**: Blue, purple, pink, and cyan tones for tech/creativity vibe

### 3. **Premium Card Design**

- **Larger cards**: 400px (mobile) / 480px (desktop) width
- **Enhanced imagery**: 16:9 aspect ratio with parallax hover effect (scale 1.1)
- **Subtle shimmer**: Gradient sweep across each card (12s loop) for added polish
- **Glass morphism**: Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Hover interactions**:
  - Lift effect: `-translate-y-2`
  - Shadow enhancement: `shadow-2xl shadow-primary/10`
  - Arrow animation: Slides right on hover
  - Image zoom: Smooth scale transition

### 4. **Enhanced Typography & Layout**

- **Section title**: Massive gradient text (5xl → 7xl responsive)
- **Featured badge**: Gradient background with shadow for visual hierarchy
- **Outcomes with bullets**: Clean dot indicators
- **Tech stack pills**: Vibrant primary color with proper truncation
- **Meta info**: Calendar and category icons with clear labels

### 5. **Category Filter**

- **Enhanced styling**: Larger touch targets (px-6 py-3)
- **Active state**: Gradient background with subtle shadow
- **Smooth transitions**: 300ms for all state changes
- **Accessibility**: Proper `aria-pressed` attributes

### 6. **Responsive Design**

- Mobile (< 640px): Cards at 400px width, single-column feel
- Tablet/Desktop (≥ 640px): Cards at 480px width
- Edge gradients: Fade edges on both sides to hide overflow seamlessly

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Language

- **Ethereal & Ambient**: Soft, floating elements that suggest innovation and creativity
- **Premium & Modern**: Glass effects, gradient text, and smooth animations
- **Tech-forward**: Blue and purple gradients aligned with AI/tech branding
- **Non-distracting**: Slow, gentle movements that enhance rather than overwhelm

### Motion Design

- **Continuous**: Carousel never stops (except on hover)
- **Smooth**: Linear easing for carousel, sine.inOut for organic elements
- **Layered**: Multiple animation layers (orbs, particles, shimmer) create depth
- **Performance-first**: All animations use GPU-accelerated properties

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

```
featured-work-carousel.tsx
├── EtherealBackground (sub-component)
│   ├── Gradient overlay
│   ├── 3x animated orbs (Framer Motion)
│   ├── 30x floating particles (Framer Motion)
│   └── Ambient light rays
│
└── FeaturedWorkCarousel (main)
    ├── Section header with gradient title
    ├── Category filter with state management
    ├── Infinite carousel container
    │   ├── GSAP timeline for continuous scroll
    │   ├── Duplicated items (3x) for seamless loop
    │   ├── Edge fade gradients
    │   └── Pause on hover
    └── CTA button to view all projects
```

### GSAP Animation Logic

```typescript
// Calculate width of one full set
const totalWidth = cardWidth * filteredItems.length;

// Create infinite timeline
gsap.timeline({ repeat: -1 }).to(carousel, {
  x: -totalWidth,
  duration: filteredItems.length * 8, // 8s per item
  ease: "none", // Linear for smooth loop
  modifiers: {
    x: (x) => `${parseFloat(x) % totalWidth}px`, // Seamless reset
  },
});
```

### Shimmer Effect

```css
@keyframes carousel-shimmer {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(200%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

Applied via Tailwind arbitrary classes with 12s duration.

## ♿ Accessibility Features

1. **Reduced Motion Support**

   - `prefersReducedMotion()` check disables all animations
   - Orbs, particles, and carousel movement all respect preference
   - Static layout remains functional and visually appealing

2. **Keyboard Navigation**

   - All cards are proper `<Link>` elements, fully keyboard accessible
   - Filter buttons have `aria-pressed` states
   - Focus states inherit from global styles

3. **Semantic HTML**

   - Proper heading hierarchy (`h2` for section title, `h3` for card titles)
   - Descriptive alt text for images
   - Meaningful link text with context

4. **Screen Reader Friendly**
   - All decorative elements are `aria-hidden` or use pseudo-elements
   - Card content is properly structured with clear hierarchy

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Bundle Impact

- **New component**: ~450 lines of TypeScript/JSX
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing GSAP, Framer Motion (no new deps)
- **Estimated bundle add**: ~8-10KB gzipped

### Animation Performance

- **GPU-accelerated**: `transform`, `opacity`, `filter` only
- **No reflows**: No layout properties animated (width, height, padding)
- **Debouncing**: Hover state managed efficiently with React state
- **Cleanup**: Proper GSAP timeline killing on unmount

### Runtime Metrics (Expected)

- **FPS**: Consistent 60fps on modern devices
- **CPU idle**: ≤2% on desktop, ≤5% on mobile
- **INP**: No blocking interactions
- **CLS**: 0 (no layout shifts, overflow hidden)

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Files Modified

1. **`src/components/sections/featured-work-carousel.tsx`** (new)
   - Complete carousel implementation
   - EtherealBackground sub-component
2. **`src/app/page.tsx`**

   - Import: `WorkGrid` → `FeaturedWorkCarousel`
   - Usage: Removed motion wrapper (carousel has internal animations)

3. **`src/app/globals.css`**
   - Added `@keyframes carousel-shimmer` animation

### Data Source

Currently uses inline `workItems` array. In production:

- Can be replaced with MDX via Contentlayer
- Or fetched from an API/CMS
- Filter logic already supports dynamic categories

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Speed Adjustment

```typescript
// Slower carousel (more time per card)
duration: filteredItems.length * 12, // 12s per item

// Faster carousel
duration: filteredItems.length * 5, // 5s per item
```

### Card Width

```tsx
// Smaller cards
w-[350px] sm:w-[420px]

// Larger cards
w-[500px] sm:w-[600px]
```

### Background Intensity

```tsx
// Reduce orb opacity
from-blue-500/10 via-purple-500/10 // 20 → 10

// Add more particles
{Array.from({ length: 50 }).map(...)} // 30 → 50
```

### Shimmer Speed

```tsx
// Faster shimmer
before:animate-[carousel-shimmer_8s_ease-in-out_infinite]

// Slower shimmer
before:animate-[carousel-shimmer_16s_ease-in-out_infinite]
```
