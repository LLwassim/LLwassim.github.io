As a Test Automation Engineer at City National Bank in Mclean, VA, I have played a pivotal role in ensuring the quality and reliability of our MERN (MongoDB, Express, Node, React) application. Since September 2021, I have been responsible for developing and maintaining automated test scripts using Cypress.js, an end-to-end testing framework. These scripts have been instrumental in validating the functionality of our UI components and user interactions.
<p>
My work has been guided by the principles of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), where I've crafted feature files, scenarios, and step definitions using Gherkin syntax, facilitating clear communication among developers, testers, and stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
In close collaboration with developers and product managers, I've translated project requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria into comprehensive and effective test scenarios. My contributions extend to designing and executing comprehensive regression test suites to identify potential defects and to ensure that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality. I've also conducted exploratory testing to uncover defects and usability issues that may not be covered by automated tests.
</p>
          </p>
          <p>To streamline our development and testing processes, I've integrated automated tests into our continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Git and Jenkins, ensuring timely feedback and faster release cycles. My active involvement in daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, and retrospective sessions has been instrumental in providing valuable insights and suggestions for improving our software development and testing procedures.</p>
          <p>
            Using JIRA, I've meticulously tracked and reported defects, working closely with developers to ensure their timely resolution and validation. 
            I've also played a role in enhancing the testability of our codebase by providing feedback on code quality, testability improvements, and best practices.
             My commitment to team growth extends to sharing knowledge, conducting knowledge-sharing sessions, and mentoring junior team members.
              In summary, my role as a Test Automation Engineer has been essential in maintaining the highest standards of quality and ensuring the seamless functionality of our critical financial software.

         <p>As a QA Automation Engineer at Allstate Insurance in Northfield Township, IL, from July 2019 to August 2021, I undertook a range of critical responsibilities to ensure the quality and reliability of our software systems. One of my notable achievements was creating an automation framework from the ground up, which seamlessly integrated Selenium WebDriver, Java, and Cucumber (BDD). This framework enabled the efficient and comprehensive testing of our applications.</p>

<p>To ensure the maintainability and modularity of our test scripts, I implemented the Page Object Model (POM) pattern using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and Cucumber. My commitment to best practices extended to practicing BDD methodologies, crafting Cucumber feature files, scenarios, and step definitions in Gherkin syntax, promoting clear communication and alignment among our development and testing teams.</p>

<p>For API testing, I effectively utilized Karate, ensuring comprehensive testing of API endpoints. To manage and organize our test cases efficiently, I employed TestNG, enabling parallel execution and streamlined test case management. My expertise in Core Java and object-oriented programming principles (OOPS) was instrumental in creating robust and maintainable automation solutions.</p>

<p>Within an Agile environment, I actively participated in Sprint planning, Review Sessions, and scrum meetings, contributing to test scenarios, cases, data, procedures, and report development. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was a key focus, and I executed it across multiple browsers and platforms using Selenium WebDriver. My role also encompassed UI, Functional, and Regression testing using the Selenium WebDriver-Cucumber Maven integration.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and efficiency in our nightly testing, I integrated automation scripts into Jenkins using the Selenium WebDriver API. JIRA served as our tool for transparent defect tracking and resolution, enabling us to maintain a high level of software quality. I took pride in preparing detailed reports on automation challenges and test results, providing actionable insights for continuous improvement.</p>

<p>My work revolved around designing test cases and scripts based on a thorough analysis of Business Requirements Documents (BRD). I conducted integration, regression, functional, and acceptance testing, meticulously analyzing results to ensure the robustness of our software. During deployment, I executed Regression and Smoke tests using Selenium WebDriver.</p>

<p>I also ventured into backend testing for data validation using SQL queries in Oracle, while Karate continued to be a valuable tool for comprehensive API validation. My active participation in daily stand-up meetings, walk-throughs, automation sessions, and assessment meetings with cross-functional teams fostered collaboration and alignment with project goals.</p>

<p>In line with Agile Scrum practices, I maintained transparent communication and actively contributed to the success of our projects. Developing reusable functions using descriptive programming was a key strategy to create efficient and maintainable test scripts. Additionally, I utilized the Postman tool for Manual Testing of API Rest Requests, further enhancing the robustness of our testing efforts. My tenure as a QA Automation Engineer at Allstate Insurance was marked by dedication to quality, innovation, and effective collaboration in the pursuit of excellence in software testing.</p>
