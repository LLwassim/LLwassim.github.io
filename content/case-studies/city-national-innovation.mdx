## The Challenge

City National Bank faced significant challenges with their mortgage processing system:

- **Long approval times**: 45-day average from application to approval
- **Sequential bottlenecks**: Each step waited for the previous to complete
- **Manual interventions**: Frequent human touchpoints slowed the process
- **Monolithic architecture**: Difficult to scale and maintain
- **Limited visibility**: Hard to identify where delays occurred

The bank needed a modern solution that could handle increasing volume while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and regulatory compliance.

## The Solution

I led the transformation of the mortgage processing platform, adopting a microservices architecture that fundamentally changed how applications flowed through the system.

### System Architecture

The platform consists of specialized microservices orchestrated through AWS SQS/SNS for event-driven, parallel processing:

```
mortgage-services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application-service    # Main orchestration & API Gateway
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credit-service        # Credit bureau integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation-service    # Document validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employment-service    # Employment verification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ document-service      # Document processing & generation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notification-service  # Real-time updates
```

### Event-Driven Processing Flow

The system uses an event-driven architecture to process applications asynchronously. When a client submits an application, it immediately returns an Application ID while verification tasks run in parallel:

<MermaidDiagram chart={`sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as Application Service
    participant Q as SQS Queues
    participant CR as Credit Service
    participant V as Validation Service
    participant E as Employment Service
    participant R as Redis Cache
    participant N as Notification Service

    C->>+A: Submit Application
    A->>R: Store Application
    A->>Q: Publish Credit Check Event
    A->>Q: Publish Validation Event
    A->>Q: Publish Employment Event
    A-->>-C: Return Application ID

    par Credit Check
        Q->>CR: Credit Check Required
        CR->>R: Check Cache
        CR->>CR: Process Credit Check
        CR->>R: Cache Results
        CR->>N: Publish Results
    and Document Validation
        Q->>V: Validation Required
        V->>V: Validate Documents
        V->>N: Publish Results
    and Employment Verification
        Q->>E: Verification Required
        E->>E: Verify Employment
        E->>N: Publish Results
    end

    N->>C: Send Status Update

`} />

`}
/>

### Key Technical Improvements

**1. Document Processing Service**

Built a robust document validation service that processes multiple document types in parallel:

```javascript
// document-service/src/index.js
const { S3, SQS, SNS } = require("aws-sdk");
const { v4: uuid } = require("uuid");
const PDFParser = require("pdf-parse");

class DocumentService {
  constructor() {
    this.s3 = new S3();
    this.sqs = new SQS();
    this.sns = new SNS();
  }

  async start() {
    while (true) {
      try {
        const messages = await this.sqs
          .receiveMessage({
            QueueUrl: process.env.DOCUMENT_QUEUE_URL,
            MaxNumberOfMessages: 5,
            WaitTimeSeconds: 20,
          })
          .promise();

        if (messages.Messages) {
          await Promise.all(
            messages.Messages.map((msg) => this.processMessage(msg))
          );
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error processing documents:", error);
      }
    }
  }

  async processMessage(message) {
    try {
      const { applicationId, documents } = JSON.parse(message.Body);
      const results = await Promise.all(
        documents.map((doc) => this.processDocument(applicationId, doc))
      );

      // Aggregate results
      const validationResult = {
        applicationId,
        status: results.every((r) => r.valid) ? "APPROVED" : "REJECTED",
        details: results,
      };

      // Store validation results
      await this.s3
        .putObject({
          Bucket: process.env.RESULTS_BUCKET,
          Key: `validations/${applicationId}.json`,
          Body: JSON.stringify(validationResult),
        })
        .promise();

      // Publish results to SNS
      await this.sns
        .publish({
          TopicArn: process.env.DOCUMENT_RESULTS_TOPIC,
          Message: JSON.stringify({
            type: "DOCUMENT_VALIDATION_COMPLETED",
            applicationId,
            result: validationResult,
          }),
        })
        .promise();

      // Delete processed message
      await this.sqs
        .deleteMessage({
          QueueUrl: process.env.DOCUMENT_QUEUE_URL,
          ReceiptHandle: message.ReceiptHandle,
        })
        .promise();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error processing document message:", error);
    }
  }

  async processDocument(applicationId, document) {
    const documentId = uuid();

    // Download document from S3
    const s3Object = await this.s3
      .getObject({
        Bucket: process.env.DOCUMENTS_BUCKET,
        Key: document.key,
      })
      .promise();

    // Parse PDF content
    const pdfData = await PDFParser(s3Object.Body);

    // Validate document based on type
    const validationResult = await this.validateDocument(
      document.type,
      pdfData
    );

    // Store processed document
    await this.s3
      .putObject({
        Bucket: process.env.PROCESSED_BUCKET,
        Key: `${applicationId}/${documentId}.json`,
        Body: JSON.stringify({
          documentId,
          originalKey: document.key,
          type: document.type,
          validation: validationResult,
          processedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        }),
      })
      .promise();

    return {
      documentId,
      type: document.type,
      valid: validationResult.valid,
      errors: validationResult.errors,
    };
  }

  async validateDocument(type, pdfData) {
    const validators = {
      W2: this.validateW2.bind(this),
      PAYSTUB: this.validatePaystub.bind(this),
      BANK_STATEMENT: this.validateBankStatement.bind(this),
      TAX_RETURN: this.validateTaxReturn.bind(this),
    };

    const validator = validators[type];
    if (!validator) {
      return { valid: false, errors: ["Unknown document type"] };
    }

    return await validator(pdfData);
  }
}
```

**2. Employment Verification with Retry Logic**

Integrated with multiple employment verification providers (Workday, TheWorkNumber, Equifax) with sophisticated retry and timeout handling:

```javascript
class EmploymentVerificationService {
  async verifyEmployment(application) {
    const providers = ["workday", "theworknumber", "equifax"];
    let attempts = 0;
    const maxRetries = 3;

    while (attempts < maxRetries) {
      try {
        // Try primary provider first
        const result = await this.callProviderWithTimeout(
          providers[attempts],
          application,
          45000 // 45 second timeout
        );

        // Update state in DynamoDB
        await this.updateVerificationState(application.id, "COMPLETED", result);

        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        attempts++;

        if (attempts >= maxRetries) {
          // Final failure, mark for manual review
          await this.updateVerificationState(
            application.id,
            "MANUAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED",
            { error: error.message }
          );
          throw error;
        }

        // Exponential backoff
        await this.delay(Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000);
      }
    }
  }

  async callProviderWithTimeout(provider, application, timeout) {
    return Promise.race([
      this.providers[provider].verify(application),
      new Promise((_, reject) =>
        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), timeout)
      ),
    ]);
  }
}
```

**3. API Response Time Optimization**

Implemented tiered timeout strategy based on verification complexity:

- **Fast Path (2-5s)**: Cached results and pre-validated data
- **Normal Path (10-15s)**: Standard API integrations
- **Slow Path (30-45s)**: Complex verifications requiring multiple sources

Timeout thresholds:

- Primary: 45 seconds
- Retry: 60 seconds
- Maximum: 2 minutes (then escalate to manual review)

**4. Redis Caching Layer**

Reduced API response times by 50%:

```javascript
// High-traffic data caching
async function getCreditScore(ssn) {
  const cacheKey = `credit:${ssn}`;
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);

  if (cached) {
    return JSON.parse(cached);
  }

  const score = await creditBureau.fetch(ssn);
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(score)); // 1 hour TTL

  return score;
}
```

**5. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**

Automated testing and deployment:

```groovy
// Simplified Jenkins pipeline
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            parallel {
                stage('Unit Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'npm run test:unit'
                    }
                }
                stage('Integration Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'npm run test:integration'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/'
                sh 'kubectl rollout status deployment/mortgage-api'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**6. AWS Cloud Infrastructure**

Comprehensive AWS deployment with containerized microservices:

- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Container orchestration for all microservices
- **AWS SQS**: Message queues for asynchronous processing and service decoupling
- **AWS SNS**: Pub/sub notifications for real-time status updates
- **API Gateway**: Secure API endpoints with throttling and monitoring
- **DynamoDB**: State management and application tracking
- **S3**: Document storage with encryption at rest and in transit
- **Redis (ElastiCache)**: Distributed caching for sub-second response times
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic capacity management based on queue depth and CPU utilization

### Critical System Features

**Reliability & Resilience**

- **Non-blocking operations**: All external calls use async patterns
- **Circuit breakers**: Automatic fallback when APIs exceed error thresholds
- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff with max 3 attempts
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues processing even if individual services fail
- **Health checks**: Automated monitoring ensures only healthy instances receive traffic

**Compliance & Auditability**

- **State tracking**: Every application state change logged in DynamoDB
- **Audit trails**: Complete history of all verification attempts and results
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest (S3, DynamoDB) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Access controls**: Role-based permissions with AWS IAM
- **Regulatory compliance**: SOC 2, PCI DSS, and GLBA standards met

**Performance & Scalability**

- **Parallel processing**: Credit, employment, and document checks run simultaneously
- **Worker threads**: CPU-intensive tasks offloaded to dedicated threads
- **Auto-scaling**: Services scale based on queue depth (target: 100 messages per instance)
- **Caching strategy**: Frequently accessed data cached with smart TTL policies
- **Connection pooling**: Reusable connections to databases and external APIs

**Observability**

- **Distributed tracing**: Track requests across all microservices
- **Centralized logging**: ELK stack aggregates logs from all services

## Technical Leadership

As Lead Software Development Engineer, I:

- **Led a team of 6 engineers** through the modernization effort
- **Collaborated with compliance** to ensure regulatory requirements
- **Presented to senior leadership** on technical strategy and progress
- **Mentored junior developers** on microservices best practices
- **Established coding standards** and review processes

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Microservices?

Chose microservices over a refactored monolith because:

1. **Independent deployments**: Update credit check without touching other services
2. **Technology flexibility**: Use Python for ML, Node.js for APIs
3. **Fault isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down entire system
4. **Team autonomy**: Smaller teams can own and iterate on services

### Why AWS?

Selected AWS for cloud infrastructure because:

1. **Mature ecosystem**: Wide range of managed services
2. **Bank requirements**: Strong compliance certifications (SOC 2, PCI DSS)
3. **Cost optimization**: Reserved instances and auto-scaling
4. **Existing expertise**: Team familiarity with AWS services

### Why Jenkins?

Chose Jenkins for CI/CD despite newer options because:

1. **Bank's existing infrastructure**: Already used organization-wide
2. **Plugin ecosystem**: Extensions for every tool we needed
3. **Pipeline as code**: Version control for deployment logic
4. **Easy integration**: Connected to existing systems seamlessly

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Incremental migration**: Moved one service at a time, reducing risk
- **Comprehensive testing**: Automated tests caught issues before production
- **Monitoring first**: Set up observability before migrating critical services
- **Team training**: Invested in upskilling team on new architecture
- **Non-blocking operations**: Async processing eliminated bottlenecks
- **Circuit breakers**: Protected system from cascading failures with timeout management

### Challenges Overcome

- **Data consistency**: Implemented saga pattern for distributed transactions
- **Service discovery**: Used Kubernetes service mesh for reliable communication
- **Debugging complexity**: Built centralized logging with ELK stack
- **Cultural change**: Helped team transition from monolith mindset
- **API timeout management**: Implemented tiered timeout strategy with exponential backoff
- **Error recovery**: Built comprehensive retry logic with state tracking for audit compliance

### Best Practices Implemented

**Error Handling & Recovery**

```javascript
try {
  // Primary verification attempt
  const result = await verificationService.verify(application);

  // Update state in DynamoDB
  await stateManager.update(application.id, "COMPLETED", result);

  // Send notification via SNS
  await notificationService.notify(application.id, result);
} catch (error) {
  // Log error with full context
  logger.error("Verification failed", {
    applicationId: application.id,
    error: error.message,
  });

  // Implement retry with exponential backoff
  if (attempts < maxRetries) {
    await delay(Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000);
    return retry();
  }

  // Escalate to manual review
  await stateManager.update(application.id, "MANUAL_REVIEW", error);
  await alertService.escalate(application.id);
}
```

**Monitoring & Alerts**

- Track API response times across all verification providers
- Monitor timeout rates and adjust thresholds dynamically
- Watch retry attempt patterns to identify degraded services
- Log all verification states for compliance and audit trails
- Alert on-call engineers for failures requiring immediate attention

**Testing Strategy**

- **Unit tests**: Each service has 90%+ code coverage
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end verification flows
- **Load testing**: Simulated 3x peak volume to validate auto-scaling
- **Failure scenario testing**: Tested timeout handling, API failures, network issues
- **Recovery testing**: Validated system recovery from partial failures

## What I'd Do Next

Looking forward, I would enhance the platform with:

1. **Real-time status tracking** so customers can see exactly where their application is in the pipeline
2. **ML-based fraud detection** integrated into the approval workflow to catch suspicious patterns early
3. **Analytics dashboard** to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities through data visualization
