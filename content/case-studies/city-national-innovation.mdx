summary: "Re-architected City National Bank's underwriting platform with resilient event orchestration, multi-signal autoscaling, and disciplined observability, shrinking credit decision latency while satisfying regulatory scrutiny."
outcomes:
  - "Underwriting cycle time reduced to under 2 hours for conforming loans"
  - "Step Functions recovery automation restored 100% of stranded workflows within 15 minutes"
  - "Poison-pill compensating SLI kept SQS redrive backlog under 25 messages"
  - "30-day DORA view improved deployment frequency to every weekday with change failure rate under 5%"
context: "City National Bank's underwriting operations were bound to a monolithic workflow engine that stalled during bursty loan demand. Manual recovery procedures regularly stretched into multi-day efforts, and the audit backlog increased whenever remediation work bypassed formal controls."
decisions:
  - "Modeled underwriting stages as Step Functions express workflows with zoned failure policies"
  - "Implemented compensating SLI/alerting for SQS redrive queues to catch poison-pill cascades"
  - "Established multi-signal ECS auto-scaling gates aligned to burn-rate SLOs"
  - "Introduced cache-aware HTTP revalidation for partner underwriting APIs"
  - "Published 30-day DORA scorecards for engineering and risk stakeholders"

## The Challenge

City National Bank's legacy underwriting suite serialized every stage of mortgage approval. SLA breaches were frequent because throughput declined during end-of-month surges, and stranded workflows required human intervention that lasted multiple shifts. Error handling was opaque, audit trails were fragmented, and the change calendar limited how quickly new controls could be shipped.

## The Solution

I led an incremental migration that reframed underwriting as event-driven choreography while protecting production stability and regulator trust.

### Underwriting-Stage Metrics

<InteractiveMetrics
  metrics={[
    {
      label: "Intake Validation p95",
      value: "140s",
      change: "down 35%",
      description:
        "Document and schema checks stabilized with asynchronous retries and staged rollouts.",
    },
    {
      label: "Credit Bureau Timeout Rate",
      value: "0.4%",
      change: "down 60%",
      description:
        "Multiattempt bureau sync with circuit breakers trimmed daily timeout incidents.",
    },
    {
      label: "Collateral Appraisal SLA",
      value: "45 min",
      change: "down 50%",
      description:
        "Async appraisal scoring kept collateral review under the sub-hour objective.",
    },
    {
      label: "Compliance Rule Latency",
      value: "8s",
      change: "down 70%",
      description:
        "Deterministic rules engine shipped with queue back-pressure telemetry.",
    },
    {
      label: "Scorecard Adoption",
      value: "Daily",
      change: "up",
      description:
        "Operations leadership consumed standardized underwriting scorecards each morning.",
    },
  ]}
/>

Each underwriting stage now exposes a standardized telemetry envelope:

- **Intake validation**: median processing time under 90 seconds, p95 under 140 seconds, success rate at 99.3%.
- **Credit bureau sync**: automated retries capped at three loops with observed timeout frequency under 0.4% per day.
- **Collateral appraisal**: median SLA under 45 minutes driven by asynchronous document scoring.
- **Compliance checks**: rule evaluation latency under 8 seconds with backlog depth visible in Grafana heatmaps.

A shared metrics schema landed in New Relic and fed a daily underwriting scorecard for operations leadership.

### Step Functions Recovery Configuration

We decomposed the monolith into Step Functions express workflows partitioned by underwriting stage. Each state machine defined:

1. **Zonal failure policies** that shifted workloads to warm standby clusters when burn-rate SLOs signaled risk.
2. **Automated roll-forward handlers** that re-queued idempotent tasks with exponential delay, keeping manual restarts under 2 per week.
3. **Replayable audit events** persisted to DynamoDB with idempotency keys so recovery preserved evidence chains.

This configuration recovered 100% of stranded workflows within 15 minutes during quarterly game-day exercises.

### SQS Poison-Pill Compensating SLI

Poison-pill messages previously created cascading failures. We established a compensating SLI that tracked:

- Redrive queue depth, alerting when it climbed above the burn-rate guardrail of 25 messages.
- Time-to-neutralize, enforced to stay under 5 minutes through automated quarantining lambdas.
- Duplicate delivery ratio, held under 0.2% with idempotent consumers.

The SLI backed an on-call runbook that coupled automated quarantining with manual review gates for high-risk loan classes.

### Multi-Signal ECS Auto-Scaling with Burn-Rate Gates

Auto-scaling moved beyond CPU thresholds. We combined:

1. **Request concurrency** sourced from ALB target tracking.
2. **Message age** pulled from SQS metrics.
3. **Error budget burn-rate** computed from Stage-level SLOs.

Only when burn-rate indicators stayed under 1.5 for fifteen minutes would horizontal scaling execute. This prevented thrash during transient partner outages while ensuring recovery stayed within the 30-minute objective.

### HTTP Revalidation Strategy

Partner underwriting APIs enforced strict rate caps. We introduced an HTTP revalidation strategy featuring:

- Conditional GETs with ETag caching to keep partner call volume under contractual maxima.
- Stale-while-revalidate windows sized to keep borrower-facing data freshness under 10 minutes.
- Circuit breakers that degraded gracefully to cached responses whenever upstream latency exceeded the under 1.2-second limit.

### 30-Day DORA View

We published a rolling 30-day DORA scorecard via Looker:

- **Deployment frequency**: daily weekday deploys aligned with change advisory approvals.
- **Lead time for changes**: median under 6 hours from merge to production.
- **Change failure rate**: under 5% while meeting control evidence requirements.
- **Mean time to recovery**: under 20 minutes thanks to Step Functions roll-forward automation.

The scorecard satisfied both engineering retrospectives and the operational risk committee's reporting cadence.

### Audit Outcome

The bank's internal audit team reviewed the migration artifacts, runbooks, and control evidence. Their closing report stated there were **no material findings related to the migration**, validating that the technical modernization met regulatory expectations without exception.
