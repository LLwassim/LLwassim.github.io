## The Vision

Based Music emerged from a critical gap in the music industry: local music scenes lack a unified platform for discovery and connection. Artists struggle to reach their community, venues can't effectively promote events, and music lovers miss incredible local talent happening nearby. We built Based Music as a **comprehensive ecosystem** that combines professional-grade audio streaming, AI-powered discovery, real-time social features, and location-based event management—all in one platform.

## Deep Dive: Audio Streaming Architecture

The audio streaming system is the technical crown jewel of Based Music. We engineered a highly optimized streaming pipeline that rivals commercial platforms.

### Challenge: iOS Audio Performance

Initial iOS load times of **900ms** were unacceptable. The root causes:

- OGG format not natively supported on iOS
- Full file download before playback
- No caching strategy
- Inefficient S3 access patterns

### Solution: Adaptive Streaming Architecture

### Implementation: Intelligent Caching & Chunking

```typescript
// Adaptive transcoding system with intelligent caching
export class AdaptiveAudioService {
  private readonly CACHE_TTL = {
    metadata: 300, // 5 minutes
    trackInfo: 3600, // 1 hour
    stream: 7200, // 2 hours
  };

  async streamAudio(trackId: string, client: ClientInfo): Promise<AudioStream> {
    // Detect client capabilities
    const profile = this.getClientProfile(client);

    // Multi-tier cache check
    const cacheKey = `${trackId}:${profile.codec}`;
    const cached = await this.cache.get(cacheKey);
    if (cached) {
      this.metrics.record("cache_hit", { trackId, codec: profile.codec });
      return this.createStreamFromCache(cached);
    }

    // Real-time transcoding for iOS AAC
    if (profile.requiresTranscode) {
      const lambda = new AWS.Lambda();
      const result = await lambda
        .invoke({
          FunctionName: "audio-transcode",
          Payload: JSON.stringify({
            source: `s3://audio-raw/${trackId}.ogg`,
            target: profile.codec,
            bitrate: profile.bitrate,
            chunkSize: profile.initialChunkSize || 65536, // 64KB
          }),
        })
        .promise();

      // Cache for future requests
      await this.cache.set(cacheKey, result.stream, this.CACHE_TTL.stream);

      return result.stream;
    }

    // Direct streaming with range requests for Android
    return this.createRangeStream(trackId, profile);
  }

  private createRangeStream(trackId: string, profile: ClientProfile) {
    return new ReadableStream({
      start: async (controller) => {
        let offset = 0;
        const chunkSize = profile.chunkSize || 1048576; // 1MB default

        while (true) {
          const chunk = await this.s3
            .getObject({
              Bucket: "based-music-audio",
              Key: `tracks/${trackId}.ogg`,
              Range: `bytes=${offset}-${offset + chunkSize - 1}`,
            })
            .promise();

          if (!chunk.Body) break;

          controller.enqueue(chunk.Body);
          offset += chunkSize;

          if (chunk.ContentLength < chunkSize) break;
        }

        controller.close();
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Recommendation Pipeline Architecture

**5-Stage Process:**

1. **Audio Analysis**: Extract features and generate embeddings (512-dim vectors)
2. **User Profiling**: Build preference model from listening history
3. **Vector Search**: Pinecone similarity search for candidate tracks
4. **Collaborative Filtering**: Incorporate behavior of similar users
5. **Context Ranking**: Final ranking with location, time, and mood factors

### Results: 45% Engagement Increase

The AI recommendation system dramatically improved user engagement:

- **45% increase** in session duration
- **3.2x more** track discoveries per session
- **68% of plays** from recommended tracks
- **Cold start solved**: New users get quality recommendations from day 1

- Full file download before playback initialization
- No caching strategy for repeat plays
- Inefficient S3 access patterns

**Solution:**

- Real-time transcoding Lambda (OGG → AAC)
- Range request implementation with 64KB initial chunks
- Multi-tier caching (Redis + CloudFront + client)
- Intelligent codec detection per device

**Result: 87% faster (900ms → 120ms)**

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Messaging at Scale

**Root Causes:**

- WebSocket connections expensive to maintain
- Message ordering and delivery guarantees needed
- Presence tracking across multiple devices
- Push notifications for offline users

- TTL-based cleanup for stale connections
- Expo push notification fallback for offline delivery

**Result: &lt;50ms message latency with 99%+ delivery rate**

### Challenge 3: Search Performance Across Multiple Tables

**Root Causes:**

- DynamoDB doesn't support full-text search natively
- Multi-table queries are complex and slow
- Need relevance scoring (exact > starts-with > contains)
- Case-insensitive search required

**Solution:**

- Search term denormalization in all tables
- Parallel DynamoDB scans for short queries
- Relevance scoring algorithm
- Lowercase indexing for case-insensitivity
- Cross-table pagination tokens

**Result: Sub-200ms search across entire platform**

### Challenge 4: AI Recommendation Cold Start

**Root Causes:**
