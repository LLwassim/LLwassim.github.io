## The Challenge

Lennar, one of America's largest homebuilders, faced a critical challenge in optimizing home prices across thousands of properties nationwide. The existing manual pricing process was:

- **Time-intensive**: Taking days to adjust prices across divisions
- **Inconsistent**: Different methodologies across regions
- **Suboptimal**: Leaving significant revenue on the table
- **Opaque**: Limited visibility into pricing rationale

<Callout type="info">
  💎 **Executive Recognition**: Now a fixture of quarterly earnings calls,
  Lennar's co-CEO and Executive Chairman Stuart Miller describes The Pricing
  Machine as "**officially the crown jewel of Lennar's tech portfolio**" and
  notes it has "**become central to our overall marketing and sales efforts**"
  with components that have "**become native to the Lennar way of selling**."
</Callout>

## The Solution

I led the architecture and development of Lennar's flagship AI-driven pricing platform, coordinating across multiple teams including QA automation, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Frontend Engineering.

### System Architecture

Full-stack enterprise platform built on modern cloud-native architecture:

### Pricing Optimization Engine

The core algorithm combines market data, historical sales, and AI predictions:

```typescript
// Simplified pricing optimization engine
export async function optimizePrice({
  property,
  marketData,
  historicalSales,
  competitorPricing,
}: PricingInputs): Promise<OptimizedPrice> {
  // AI model integration with GPT-4o for market analysis
  const basePrice = await mlModel.predictOptimalPrice({
    features: extractFeatures(property, marketData),
    constraints: getBusinessConstraints(),
  });

  // Apply margin optimization strategy
  const optimizedPrice = applyMarginStrategy(basePrice, {
    targetMargin: property.division.targetGrossMargin,
    marketConditions: marketData.currentConditions,
    competitorPricing: competitorPricing,
  });

  return {
    recommendedPrice: optimizedPrice,
    confidence: calculateConfidence(historicalSales),
    marginImpact: calculateMarginDelta(property.currentPrice, optimizedPrice),
    rationale: generateExplanation(optimizedPrice, property),
  };
}
```

### Key Features

**1. Real-Time Price Optimization**

- AI algorithms analyze market conditions, competitor pricing, and historical data
- Recommendations updated continuously as market conditions change
- Explainable AI provides clear rationale for each pricing decision
- Confidence scoring for every recommendation

**2. Enterprise-Wide Integration**

The platform integrates across Lennar's entire technology ecosystem:

> "It operates on a Salesforce backbone, which ingests data from across the Lennar sales landscape."
>
> — **Stuart Miller**, co-CEO and Executive Chairman, Lennar Q2 2025 Earnings Call

**3. User-Centric Design**

Built frontend UX flows ensuring seamless connection from user input to algorithmic output:

```typescript
// Pricing workflow implementation
const PricingWorkflow = () => {
  const [property, setProperty] = useState<Property>();
  const [optimizedPrice, setOptimizedPrice] = useState<OptimizedPrice>();

  // Step 1: Property Selection
  const handlePropertySelect = async (propertyId: string) => {
    const propertyData = await api.getProperty(propertyId);
    setProperty(propertyData);
  };

  // Step 2: AI Price Optimization
  const handleOptimize = async () => {
    const result = await api.optimizePrice(property.id, {
      includeMarketAnalysis: true,
      generateRationale: true,
    });
    setOptimizedPrice(result);
  };

  // Step 3: Review & Adjustment
  const handleAdjust = (adjustedPrice: number) => {
    // Allow practitioners to fine-tune AI recommendations
    const updated = { ...optimizedPrice, price: adjustedPrice };
    setOptimizedPrice(updated);
  };

  // Step 4: Approval & Sync
  const handleApprove = async () => {
    // Push approved price to JDE and Salesforce
    await api.approvePrice(property.id, optimizedPrice);
    // Trigger sync across all systems
    await api.syncToERP(property.id);
  };

  return (
    <PricingDashboard
      property={property}
      optimizedPrice={optimizedPrice}
      onOptimize={handleOptimize}
      onAdjust={handleAdjust}
      onApprove={handleApprove}
    />
  );
};
```

**UX Features:**

- Intuitive React-based interface for division practitioners and regional teams
- Role-based access control with granular permissions (view, edit, approve)
- Mobile-responsive design for field access and on-the-go decision making
- Real-time collaboration with live updates across teams
- Bulk operations for adjusting thousands of properties simultaneously

    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY bp.market_avg_price)
      OVER (PARTITION BY bp.division_id) AS median_market_price,
    -- Calculate recommended price adjustment
    CASE
      WHEN bp.days_on_market > 90 THEN bp.current_price * 0.97
      WHEN ca.avg_competitor_price < bp.current_price THEN ca.avg_competitor_price * 1.02
      ELSE bp.current_price
    END as recommended_price
  FROM base_pricing bp
  LEFT JOIN competitor_analysis ca ON bp.property_id = ca.property_id
)
SELECT
  *,
