The existing manual pricing process was:\n\n- **Time-intensive**: Taking days to adjust prices across divisions\n- **Inconsistent**: Different methodologies across regions\n- **Suboptimal**: Leaving significant revenue on the table\n- **Opaque**: Limited visibility into pricing rationale\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  💎 **Executive Recognition**: Now a fixture of quarterly earnings calls,\n  Lennar's co-CEO and Executive Chairman Stuart Miller describes The Pricing\n  Machine as \"**officially the crown jewel of Lennar's tech portfolio**\" and\n  notes it has \"**become central to our overall marketing and sales efforts**\"\n  with components that have \"**become native to the Lennar way of selling**.\"\n</Callout>\n\n## The Solution\n\nI led the architecture and development of Lennar's flagship AI-driven pricing platform, coordinating across multiple teams including QA automation, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Frontend Engineering.\n\n### System

and video tutorials\n- Conducted hands-on workshops for division practitioners\n- Built in-app guidance and tooltips for complex features\n- Provided 24/7 support during initial rollout phases\n\n<Callout type=\"success\">\n  🎯 **Cross-Functional Success**: The key to this project's success was\n  seamless coordination across multiple teams. By establishing clear\n  communication channels, shared goals, and modular architecture, we enabled\n  each team to work independently while maintaining system cohesion. This\n  approach resulted in faster delivery, higher quality, and 100% adoption across\n  all divisions.\n\nThe platform's components have \"**become native to the Lennar way of selling**\" — a testament to how deeply integrated and essential the system has become to daily operations.\n\n</Callout>\n\n## Executive Recognition\n\nThe platform has become a regular highlight in Lennar's quarterly earnings calls:\n\n![Stuart Miller, co-CEO and Executive Chairman of Lennar, discusses The Pricing Machine as the crown jewel of Lennar's tech portfolio in Q2 2025 Earnings Call](/images/lennar-ceo-earnings-call.png)\n\n_Stuart Miller, co-CEO and Executive Chairman, Lennar Q2 2025 Earnings Call_\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n💎 **\"The Crown Jewel of Lennar's Tech Portfolio\"**\n\n\"Now a fixture of quarterly earnings calls, many agree that The Pricing Machine is officially the crown jewel of Lennar's tech portfolio... The machine, which is overseen by Ori Klein, Jeff Moses and Ben Locke, and they do an amazing job. It was and still is our primary digital marketing and customer acquisition product and it has become central to our overall marketing and sales efforts... The machine's components have become native to the Lennar way of selling.\"\n\n— **Stuart Miller**, co-CEO and Executive Chairman  \nLennar Q2 2025 Earnings Call\n\n</Callout>\n\n_This project demonstrates my ability to lead complex, high-impact technical initiatives that directly drive business value at the highest executive level. The combination of technical excellence, cross-team coordination, and focus on measurable outcomes—recognized publicly by C-suite leadership as the \"crown jewel\" of the company's tech portfolio—exemplifies my approach to principal-level engineering._\n",
