      <p>     
I'm excited to introduce my comprehensive Banking application, a sophisticated educational tool designed to help my students learn how to emulate real-world testing scenarios within the realm of a banking application. This project leverages a robust technology stack that includes React, Express, MySQL, AWS RDBS, AWS EC2, Node.js, Passport.js, React Authentication, Material UI, and Axios,Hosted on Github Pages, Deployed on AWS EC2, Using Nginx for Reverse Proxy, With a custom domain and SSL certificate handled by OPENSSL supported by Postman for API testing.
<br>The goal of this application is to provide a practical and immersive environment for students to gain hands-on experience in software testing, development, and deployment. It's equipped with a plethora of features and functionalities that mimic the intricacies of real banking systems. This allows students to apply their knowledge in a dynamic and interactive setting, enabling them to gain a deep understanding of the intricacies of the banking sector and how to rigorously test and maintain such systems.
<br>One notable aspect of this project is its integration with JIRA, a widely used project management tool. It has its own JIRA project with user stories and tickets, mirroring the professional workflow in the software development industry. This empowers students to learn project management practices and agile methodologies, preparing them for the demands of the real world.
<br>With React on the front end, students can explore responsive and user-friendly interfaces, while Express, Node.js, and MySQL on the back end provide a strong foundation for data management and server-side functionalities. Passport.js and React Authentication ensure that user data remains secure, adhering to best practices for authentication and authorization.
<br>The user interface, designed with Material UI, offers an intuitive and visually appealing experience, making it easier for students to interact with the application. They can navigate various banking operations seamlessly, such as account management, fund transfers, transaction history, and more
<br>Additionally, the application interfaces with external services through the Axios library, allowing students to understand how real-world systems interact with external APIs and services. Postman integration further supports students in comprehensively testing their API endpoints and ensuring their functionality meets industry standards.
<br>AWS plays a pivotal role in this project, as AWS RDBS provides a scalable and reliable database solution, while AWS EC2 facilitates the deployment of the application on cloud servers. This mirrors the modern deployment and scaling practices widely used in the industry.
<br>In summary, this Banking application offers a holistic educational experience, covering a wide range of skills and technologies necessary for a successful career in software development and testing. By combining a rich tech stack with real-world testing scenarios, JIRA integration, and practical project management, this application equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in the dynamic world of software development and testing.</p>

        <p>
Introducing my open-source project on GitHub, the LinkedIn Easy Apply Automation Bot, born out of my own frustration with LinkedIn's time-consuming job application process. This bot automates the tedious aspects of applications, like personal info and resume uploads, and lets users customize their job search criteria.
<br>I'm thrilled to offer this project as open source, welcoming collaboration from developers and job seekers. Together, we can improve its functionality, fix issues, and adapt it for various needs.
<br>I prioritize ethics and privacy, ensuring the bot aligns with LinkedIn's terms of service and ethical usage practices. Comprehensive documentation is provided for users of all technical levels.
I hope this project helps job seekers streamline their LinkedIn job search. Visit it on GitHub, and let's simplify job hunting for everyone!

            In an Agile software development setting, I collaborated with a team of 20+ software engineers to fully develop a website for a client.<br>
             We followed Agile methodologies throughout the project, allowing us to iterate and adapt quickly to the client's evolving needs.<br>
              I primarily contributed to the backend development using Django and Python, incorporating a SQL database for data management.<br>
               Additionally, I played a role in planning and implementing the frontend, utilizing React to create a user-friendly and interactive interface. <br>
               The website has been successfully completed and is currently being used by the client.<br>
