## What Has Been Built

You now have a **production-ready, high-performance portfolio website** for Wassim LaCorchy that rivals the best portfolios in the industry. This is a complete rebuild from the ground up using cutting-edge web technologies and motion design principles.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. **Next.js 14 App Router Architecture**

- Modern React Server Components architecture
- Static export capability for GitHub Pages
- Route-based code splitting for optimal performance
- TypeScript for type safety throughout

### 2. **Triple-Layer Motion System**

#### Layer 1: Native CSS (Default)

- **Scroll-driven animations** using CSS `@scroll-timeline` and `animation-timeline: view()`
- **View Transitions API** for seamless route changes
- Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth 60fps animations
- Automatic respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`

#### Layer 2: GSAP Precision Animations (3 Signature Sequences)

1. **Hero Sequence** (≤900ms)

   - Headshot mask-reveal with scale animation
   - Gradient ring spin-in effect
   - Per-word headline rise animation
   - Ends idle with no CPU usage

2. **Case Study Scrub** (<120vh pinned)

   - Pinned scrolling with progress bar
   - Image scale from 1.08→1
   - Headline clip-path opening animation
   - Metrics count-up on first view

3. **Magnetic CTA**
   - 160px proximity activation radius
   - Spring physics on hover
   - <2% CPU usage when idle
   - Deactivates when not in use

#### Layer 3: Lenis Smooth Scroll

- Buttery smooth scrolling experience
- Integrated with GSAP ScrollTrigger via scrollerProxy
- Respects native anchor links
- Disabled on reduced motion preference

### 3. **Content Management System (MDX + Contentlayer)**
